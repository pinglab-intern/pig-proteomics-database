# Pig Proteomics Database

Contributors: Sartaaj Khan, Alexander Pelletier

Pig proteomics is highly beneficial in therapeutics, understanding mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases and understanding physiological properties of hearts. As pig proteomic cardiac studies are not as well-defined compared to its human or mouse counterparts, the aim of this project was to develop a bioinformatics tool that removes the redundant and incorrect protein sequences in the pig protein database.
